### Demo

Mona Lisa                 |  Lona Misa (Made up of AmongUs characters)
<img src="./output.png" width=800 />

### API
I've also added an API that you can use to convert images to amongus characters - it's completely free and open source on the `api` branch.

POST https://sussy.api.dhravya.dev  (Pass input_image as a base64 encoded image in the body)

You can also specify the `atol` by passing it as a query parameter.
